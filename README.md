# REx
Two simple vision tools using YOLO and voice feedback.

## Whatâ€™s This?
This repo has two scripts:
1. **YOLO Smart Interaction**: Detects objects like Chair, Sofa, Table and says them aloud.
2. **YOLO + Dynamic Talk-Back**: Adds scene descriptions and smart responses (e.g., "I see a Chair for the first time!").

## How to Use
There is Requirement.txt file in both the cases and readme file as well.

## Basics
- Both use a webcam and YOLO (`best.pt` for custom objects).
- Part 1 is fast and simple; Part 2 is fun with scene descriptions (via BLIP).
- Press `q` to stop.
